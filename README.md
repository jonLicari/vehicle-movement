# Project: 
vehicle-movement
## Description: 
Project developed to provide vehicle movement for an RC car powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 
The vehicle aims to achieve the following functionalities:
- forward/ reverse movement 
- speed control by PWM
- time-based turn functions

Turn functions that execute for a predetermined amount of time lack overall mobility
and give the vehicle a two dimensional feel. By using time-based functions, the vehicle
can achieve much better angles of movement by executing the turn function for varying
amounts of time.
